# What is this?
Well I got bored yesterday and I decided to try out the [Rust By Example Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example) to Learn Rust.

# Thoughts so far
(2024-04-13, 18:38pm): Seems um different but interesting, and it's making me think about memory allocation much more than Python would.
(2024-04-13, 19:44pm): I have a lot of trouble with the borrowing etc of variables, I kinda get tripped up by it often, for example the `get` function in what is soon to be `linked_list.rs` that i rewrote threw an error when i used `match` but not when i used `if...else`. I remember having some issues like this learning python (objects and classes), so hopefully this irons out later like those did.
